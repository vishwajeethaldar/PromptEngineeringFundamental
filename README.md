### What is Generative AI?
**Generative AI** is the branch of artificial intelligence that can generate new data - in text or images (and soon video). This type of AI has supercharged the ability to create new works of writing, code, and design for millions of users. Suddenly, our AI companions help us write or create unique images in seconds instead of hours.

ChatGPT is a conversational GPT model created by OpenAI, one of the leading artificial intelligence companies in the world.

## NLP
**Natural language processing**, or NLP, is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that sits at the intersection of computer science and human language. It aims to teach computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in written and spoken form. NLP is the science of training a computer how to talk and understand the same human language we do. NLP algorithms use various machine learning techniques to understand human language. Still, the one that has stood out in performance over the last few years is the GPT or Generative Pre-trained Transformer architecture.

## GPT
**The Generative Pre-trained Transformer** (architecture) is most commonly known as GPT. The GPT model is a type of neural network that is pre-trained on a large corpus of text data - all publicly available books, articles, and websites on the internet. The transformer model was first featured in the Attention is All You Need paper from Google Research in June 2017 and showed surprisingly remarkable performance for NLP tasks. The impact was beyond the imagination of its authors. The transformer became the go-to model for NLP applications throughout the machine-learning community.


## Prompt Engineering
Prompt Engineering is the skill of crafting prompts to get the best response from LLMs like ChatGPT.

ChatGPT has no context of who you are; what you look like; what your occupation is; what problem you’re trying to solve; what task you’re trying to do; what program you’re trying to write.

ChatGPT does have a general idea of everything on the internet (trained till early 2022*). I like to think of ChatGPT as a probability engine for language. Specifically, the language it’s been trained on till early 2022. You write a prompt, and ChatGPT responds with the highest probability general answer - the completion.

### Six Principles for Effective Prompt Crafting
1 ) Start simple and iterate:

Starting simple and iterating will help you get started quickly & tweak your way to the right prompt.

As we go through examples that boost your productivity as a coder, you will see many examples where simplicity, relevance, and context will tend to yield better results.

With each iteration, ChatGPT learns in the context of the chat conversation. And starting simple also allows you to keep the conversation focused and not veer in unrelated directions.

2 ) One clear instruction:

Giving ChatGPT one clear instruction is often the best way to get effective results.

ChatGPT is capable of many instructions: summarize, write, text/code, explain, translate, give me the top five, classify, etc.

It’s often best to break apart more complex tasks and focus on one instruction at a time.

According to OpenAI’s section on how to control LLMs, they recommend splitting complex tasks into simpler tasks.

3 ) Give context

ChatGPT has no context of your life, your career, your skills, or your experience.

Giving context is one of the most effective things you can do to get a better response. The more relevant information you can give ChatGPT, the more customized its response will be to your task.

For example, I want ChatGPT to write a cover letter for me.

4 ) Use specific, relevant words. Domain experience and terminology will improve output.

Writing effective prompts means adding specific, relevant words to your prompts. This will give ChatGPT more precise words to work with.

Bad example:

Prompt: "What is the best programming language I should learn?”

This prompt is vague, and ChatGPT will likely conclude that it depends on your circumstance.

Good example:

"What is the most versatile programming language for data science and machine-learning?"

5 ) Few-shot learning: examples, examples, examples

Examples - demonstrations or few-shot learning - are among the most effective spells in your spellbook to control LLMs.

Let’s pretend you want to create dummy data for your Harry Potter spellbook app.

Bad prompt:

“Create dummy data for my app.”


## Common Mistakes and Limitations of ChatGPT

Three Common Mistakes of Bad Prompts
Avoid these three common mistakes:

1 ) Vague or verbose prompts

One of the most frequent mistakes is creating prompts that are either too vague or too verbose. These prompts can confuse ChatGPT and make it difficult to generate a coherent response. It's important to strike a balance between being specific and concise, while also providing enough context for the AI to understand what you're asking.

Vague: "Tell me about AI."
Verbose: "In this prompt, I would like to request that you provide me with a detailed explanation of the concept of Artificial Intelligence, including its history, current developments, and potential future applications."
2 ) Biased prompts

Another pitfall to watch out for is biased prompts. Bias can creep into your prompts in all kinds of ways, whether it's through the use of loaded language or assumptions about the user's background or beliefs. This can lead to responses that are narrow-minded or leading the responses in one way. Be mindful of your own biases, and try to keep your prompts neutral and inclusive.

"Why does the X political party tend to have different approaches to solving economic issues?"
"What's the best way to avoid dealing with the incompetence of lazy millennials?"
3 ) Incomplete and poorly formatted prompts

Finally, avoid creating incomplete or poorly formatted prompts. These can cause ChatGPT to misinterpret your intentions or produce low-quality responses.

Always double-check your prompts for spelling and grammar errors, and make sure you provide all the necessary information for the AI to generate a complete and accurate response. By avoiding these common mistakes, you'll be well on your way to crafting high-quality prompts that can unlock the full potential of ChatGPT.

Incomplete: "What do you think about...?"
Poorly formatted: "I have a question about. (No context provided. The prompt is too short and has an improper structure.)
Limitations of ChatGPT
1 ) Hallucination

It’s also important to understand the limitations of ChatGPT.

One significant challenge is the issue of "hallucination," where ChatGPT can sometimes generate responses that sound very convincing but aren’t true! This can happen when the AI generates text that is technically coherent but lacks any meaningful correctness to reality.

2 ) Limited to 2022 Dataset. No live internet data (yet…)

Another important limitation to keep in mind is the fact that ChatGPT is only trained on data up to a certain point in time, which means it's limited to the information that was available at that time.

For example, the current version of ChatGPT was trained on data up to 2022, which means it may not be up-to-date on the latest trends or events.

It's important to keep these limitations in mind when using ChatGPT and to be cautious about relying on it for tasks that require a high level of accuracy or precision. However, despite these limitations, ChatGPT is still an incredibly powerful tool that can be used in various contexts to generate high-quality text and facilitate natural language interactions.
